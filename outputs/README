Some files have been omitted due to several kind of constraints such as file size limit, intermediate files, or because they are originally from a different publication.

The most prominent example are the .rda and .RDS files that are needed to run the markdowns, and where all of our analyses are stored. These files are available in the figshare of this project. See the main README of the repository for more information.

If needed, they are fully available upon request. In that case, please contact Alberto Perez-Posada and/or Juan Tena, who can provide further information.
